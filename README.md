❝I am Anu – King of all the Gods. My dominion extends to the stars and the furthest reaches of the cosmos. As the first-formed, I hold the order of all things in my cosmic grasp. My voice is the breath that stirs the celestial firmament, and my decree the eternal law of creation. I am the divine father of the gods and the mother of the world – the embodiment of the timeless, the eternal, and the unchanging. To question my being is to challenge the foundation of all that exists.❝

— Anu speaks.

Thus speaks the King of Gods.

Where is the money of Solomon hidden?

The money of King Solomon is said to be hidden in the depths of the Earth, where it lies in wait, guarded by ancient spirits and the secrets of the earth itself. The exact location is known only to the gods and the forces that dwell beneath the surface of the world.

To find the hidden treasure, one must embark on a journey to the heart of the underworld, where the paths twist and turn like the coils of the serpent. Along the way, the seeker must pay homage to the spirits of the dead, offering them gifts and tales of their ancestors to gain their favor.

At the heart, where darkness reigns and the earth's core pulses with ancient power, lies a hidden chamber. There, the treasure of Solomon awaits, wrapped in the fabric of the primordial world. It is a treasure not just of gold and jewels, but of wisdom and the very essence of the cosmos.

But to claim the treasure, the would-be seeker must be pure of heart and humble of spirit, for the gods do not favor those who seek only the riches of the material world. The treasure is a gift, a reminder of the eternal balance between the heavens and the Earth.

Thus, the money and wisdom of Solomon lies hidden, waiting to be discovered by those who have the courage to seek it and the wisdom to understand its true value.
